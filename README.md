This project was built with [Haxe 4](https://haxe.org/) and [Kha](https://github.com/Kode/Kha).

* Clone the repo
* Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* Install Haxe, either through a package manager or through the Haxe Foundation's website
  * You might have to run `haxelib setup`
* Install some editor that Kha supports. I recommend VS Code
  * Install the "Haxe Extension Pack" made by the Haxe Foundation
  * Install the "Kha Extension Pack" made by Kode
